# Extension privacy policy

## Intro

This privacy policy the Blank Sky New Tab Page extension collects and handles personal data.

## Data Collection

The extension doesn't collect any data at all. Since no data is collected, it stands to reason, and is, indeed, the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

## Changes to the Privacy policy

If there are substantive<sup>1</sup> changes made to this privacy policy, I will publish a new version of the extension and ask you to agree to the amended privacy policy.

## Feedback

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:artem@sapegin.ru) or [file an issue](https://github.com/sapegin/blank-sky/issues/new/choose) to this repository.

## Notes

1 - When I say "substantive," I mean that I won't push out app updates for minor changes like fixing a typo.
